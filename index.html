          <p>You read that correctly! The Moon is gradually drifting away from Earth at a rate of approximately 4 cm per year. This phenomenon is caused by the Moon pulling on Earthâ€™s oceans creating tidal forces that produce a bulge of water on the side of Earth facing the Moon.</p>
          <p>This bulge in turn creates a gravitational pull on the Moon, causing it to accelerate slightly and move further away from Earth. Over time, this process has caused the Moon to move farther away from Earth each year.
          This gradual drift is not noticeable on a day-to-day basis, but over millions of years, it can have significant effects on Earth's rotation.</p>

      <p>Europe is known for its diverse cultures, rich history and stunning landmarks. Despite being the second smallest continent in size (after Australia), Europe is home to a staggering population of over 746 million people, making it the third largest continent in terms of population (after Asia and Africa). 

        <br> Europe has one of the highest levels of urbanisation in the world, with over 75% of its population living in urban areas. With the world's population expected to reach 9.7 billion in 2050, we must increase efforts to understand and mitigate the challenges brought by rapid and unplanned urbanisation, air pollution, as well as issues related to the management of water and energy.
